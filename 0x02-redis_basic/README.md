## Overview
Remote Dictionary Service (Redis) is a high-performance in-memory data structure store that is widely used as a caching solution, database and a message broker due to its speed, versatility, and rich feature set.

## Purpose
This project aims at providing an hands-on experience with working with Redis and familiarizing with its fundamental concepts and usage. This is achieved through a series of tasks that offer practical knowledge on integrating Redis with Python applications, performing basic operations, and leveraging Redis features such as caching and data storage.

## Learning objectives
- Redis Basics: Learning how to interact with Redis, including storing and retrieving data, using various data types, and executing basic commands.
- Caching with Redis: Understanding how to utilize Redis as a caching mechanism to improve application performance and efficiency.
- Python Integration: Gaining roficiency in integrating Redis with Python applications, leveraging Redis Python client libraries and implementing Redis functionality within Python code.
- Decorator Patterns: Exploring advanced Python concepts such as decorators and function wrapping to enhance code functionality and maintainability.

## Tasks
    * Writing strings to Redis
    * Reading from Redis and recovering original type
    * Incrementing values
    * Storing lists
    * Retrieving lists
